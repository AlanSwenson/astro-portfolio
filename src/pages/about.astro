        I am a freelance fullstack web developer living and working in lovely Minneapolis. 
        In my previous life, I spent 12 years delivering top-tier audio projects for big name brands and politicians with the fastest turnaround in the industry, in doing so I helped develop and create proprietary software tools for the company to go from audition to final product faster than the competition. 
        <h3 class="mt-4 font-semibold uppercase">Hobbies</h3>    
        Outside of work, I enjoy the wonderful world of being a Maker.
        I love going to Art and History museums, eating at amazing restaurants and drinking the amazing craft beers around Minneapolis and going to Twins games during baseball season.
